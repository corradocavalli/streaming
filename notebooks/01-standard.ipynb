Every morning, he would read his newspaper, sipping his coffee, sitting in his favorite armchair. Whiskers found this routine quite boring and decided to spice things up a bit.\n",

      "Mr. Johnson, completely unaware of the switch, added a spoonful of \"sugar\" into his coffee. He sat down in his armchair, newspaper in one hand, coffee in the other. As he took his first sip, his face contorted in surprise and disgust. He spat out the coffee, exclaiming, \"What on earth?!\"\n",

      "Whiskers, watching from a distance, couldn't help but let out a soft, mischievous purr. His plan had worked! He had successfully pranked his human. From that day forward, Mr. Johnson always tasted his coffee before sitting down to read his newspaper, and Whiskers, well, he was just getting started with his pranks.\n",
